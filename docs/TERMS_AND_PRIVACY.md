## 6. Third-Party Services  
Where third-party processors are required (e.g., cloud hosting, email delivery), we choose vendors that comply with GDPR, CCPA, and similar regulations. Data is shared only under strict contractual obligations and never for marketing.

## 7. Security

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to:
